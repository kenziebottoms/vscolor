# VS Color

This app is a tool for basic color theme generation for Visual Studio Code. I used the [Old Hope Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dustinsanders.an-old-hope-theme-vscode) as a base and edit it as needed.

This tool accepts a foreground and background color and uses shades of a gradient between the two to generate graduated UI colors. It accepts a UI accent color, a positive color, and a negative color. The positive/negative colors are used for error- and validation-related syntax highlighting and for Git integration highlights. It accepts up to 5 colors for syntax highlighting but works best with 4 or 5. You can shuffle the syntax colors.

This tool exports themes as a JSON object, the "spine", which can then be imported. The 'Save' button saves the theme in local storage. You can copy the resultant theme as either the app-specific "spine", as workspace settings for immediate testing, or as theme code.
